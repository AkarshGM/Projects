All my Practices, Projects and Case Studies are uploaded and organised in separate folders.
Please navigate through the Folders w.r.t Excel, SQL, Python, Exploratory Data Analysis and Tableau.

Tableau Folder includes link to my Tableau Public Profile.

Naming of the files are according to the Certification Program on Professional Data Analytics Course I completed from NIIT Institute during the period Feb 2023 - Jul 2023.
The batch started from February. Hence the month February is mentioned in all my practice file names.

Folders represent each courses and Sprints represent weekly concept/topic practices.
